              The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built
              in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that
              year, while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.
              Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in
              1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished
              five years later. The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's
              grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story
              held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal. According to
              contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori
              and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, he did not show the same level of
              affection to others as he had shown her while she was alive. He
              avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief, along with
              giving up listening to music and dressing lavishly for two years.
              Shah Jahan was enamored by the beauty of the land at the south
              side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I
              stood. This place was chosen for the construction of Mumtaz's tomb
              by Shah Jahan and Jai Singh agreed to donate it to the emperor.

              The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in
              Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh Sabha Movement between
              1883 and the 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and
              1966. In the early 1980s, the gurdwara became a centre of conflict
              between the Indian government and a radical movement led by
              Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
              sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, leading to
              deaths of more than 1,000 soldiers, militants and civilians, as
              well as causing much damage to the gurdwara and the destruction of
              Akal Takht. The gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984
              damage. The Golden Temple is an open house of worship for all
              people, from all walks of life and faiths.It has a square plan
              with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around the pool.
              The four entrances to the gurudwara symbolises the Sikh belief in
              equality and the Sikh view that all people are welcome into their
              holy place.

              The Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram occupies a distinct
              position in classical Indian architecture. These majestic edifices
              mark the high quality of craftsmanship in the region during 6th
              century CE. The natural landscape was utilized in carving out
              these structures, thereby making the ability of the Pallava
              craftsmen universally known. The monuments may be subdivided into
              five categories: The rock reliefs: The sculptural bas reliefs are
              another very important class of masterly creations created during
              Mamalla’s reign. There are four such reliefs at Mamallapuram, the

              Govardhanadhari. Raj in 1827. The temples: King Rajasimha
              introduced structural architecture on a grand scale. The earliest
              and most modest is the Mukundanayananar temple, followed by the
              Olakkanesvara temple, perched on a rock near the lighthouse. The
              tempo of structural edifices culminated in the creation of the
              famous Shore temple, having the most finite layout of a Dravida
              vimana, majestically fringing the sea.

              Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited
              cities. Kashi, its ancient name, was associated with a kingdom of
              the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Lion capital of Ashoka at
              nearby Sarnath has been interpreted to be a commemoration of the
              Buddha's first sermon there in the fifth century BCE.In the 8th
              century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an
              official sect of Varanasi. Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language
              epic, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement reworking of the
              Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the
              Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and
              Ravidas.In the 16th century, Rajput nobles in the service of the
              courts and armies of the Mughal emperor Akbar, sponsored the
              building or further enhancement of the major Shiva temple in the
              city; they also built other temples, all displaying an empire-wide
              architectural style.Under the Treaty of Faizabad, the Banaras
              Kingdom became a subordinate under the East India Company in 1775,
              the city later successively becoming a part of the Benares
              Division in the Ceded and Conquered Provinces in 1805, the
              North-Western Provinces in 1836, and the United Provinces 1902,
              and Uttar Pradesh in 1950.
